# Project Overview: 
TigerTix is a microservice-based event ticketing system that allows users to: 
- Browse upcoming events 
- Register and log in
- Book tickets via UI or AI-powered natural language booking 
- Confirm ticket purchases through a secure flow
- Interact with a chat-based LLM assistant for event discovery and booking 
- Use voice input for conversational ticket booking 
The platform is designed for reliability, modularity, automated testing, and ease of deployment. 
It includes separate Admin and Client services, a shared SQLite database, and a React frontend. 

# Tech Stack 
Frontend
- React 
- React Router 
- Fetch API
- React Testing Library + Jest 
- jsdom testing environment 
Backend
- Node.js + Express 
- Microservices architecture 
    - Admin Service (event creation, deletion)
    - Client Service (purchase, chat, LLM flow, confirmation)
- SQLite (in production and development) 
- In-memory SQLite for automated testing
- Supertest + Jest for regression tests
AI/LLM Integration
- OpenAI API 
- used to parse natural-language ticket-booking intents
- Automatic fallback parser when LLM unavailable 

# Architecture Summary
TigerTix is built as three main components, coordinated through a shared database: 
1. Admin Service
- creates events 
- deletes events 
- retrieves events 
- runs on port 5001
- data flow: Frontend (admin panel) -> Admin service -> SQLite DB
2. Client Service
- retrieves events 
- processes ticket purchases
- handles pending bookings 
- manages LLM parse + confirmation flow 
- handles voice input 
- runs on port 6001 
- data flow: 
    - Frontend <-> Client Service <-> SQLite DB
    - Frontend <-> Client Service <-> OpenAI API
3. Frontend
- user login/registration UI 
- event browsing 
- ticket purchasing
- LLM chat window 
- voice-enabled ticket booking
- communicates only with the backend services never directly with SQLite 
Database Layer: 
- Tables: 
    - events 
    - pending_bookings 
- each service loads shared DB utilities so they behave like a unified system

# Installation and Setup Instructions 
1. Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/TigerTix.git
cd TigerTix
2. Backend Setup: 
- install admin-service
cd backend/admin-service
npm install
- install client-service
cd ../client-service
npm install
- initialize the shared SQLite database
cd ../shared-db
node init.js
3. Frontend Setup: 
cd ../../frontend
npm install

Environment Variables Setup: 
- Backend (client-service/.env)
    - Create:
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    PORT=6001
    NODE_ENV=development
    - If no key is provided, the system gracefully falls back to the rule-based parser.
- Frontend (.env)
    REACT_APP_CLIENT_API=http://localhost:6001
    REACT_APP_ADMIN_API=http://localhost:5001

Running the Application: 
- Admin service: 
cd backend/admin-service
npm start
- Client service: 
cd backend/client-service
npm start
- Frontend: 
cd frontend
npm start
- the app will open at http://localhost:3000

How to Run Regression Tests: 
- Backend Tests: All backend tests use Jest + Supertest and in-memory SQLite.
Run:
cd backend
npm test
Tests included:
- Model tests (Admin & Client)
- purchaseTicket logic
- confirmBooking logic
- Authentication middleware
- Mocked LLM parse tests

- Frontend Tests: Frontend uses React Testing Library + Jest.
Run:
cd frontend
npm test
Tests included:
- uiHelpers.js utility functions
- Basic rendering tests
- Skipped CRA boilerplate test to avoid false failures
